# Question 3
## Problem Statement
Define a class named `Book` with the following member variables: 
- `bookId` (an integer representing the unique ID of the book) 
- `price` (a double representing the price of the book) 
- `quantity` (an integer representing the quantity of books purchased) 
Additionally, include a static variable `totalAmount` to keep track of the total amount spent on all books.

The class should have: 
- A parameterized constructor to initialize the bookId, price, and quantity. Note: Use `this`. 
- A `displayDetails()` method to print the details of the book (i.e., `bookId`, `price`, `quantity`). 
- A method to calculate and return the total cost for that book (`price` * `quantity`). 
- Update the static variable `totalAmount` to include the total cost of the book purchased. 
Now, write a separate Main class to simulate the purchasing of 5 different books. Display the details of each book, and finally, display the total amount spent on the purchase of all books

## Solution
```java
class Book {
    private int bookId;
    private double price;
    private int quantity;

    static double totalAmount = 0;

    Book(int bookId, double price, int quantity) {
        this.bookId = bookId;
        this.price = price;
        this.quantity = quantity;

        totalAmount += calculateCost();
    }

    public double calculateCost() {
        return price * quantity;
    }

    public void displayDetails() {
        System.out.println("Book ID: " + bookId);
        System.out.println("Price: " + price);
        System.out.println("Quantity: " + quantity);
        System.out.println("Total cost for this book: " + calculateCost());
        System.out.println("-----------------------------------");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Book b1 = new Book(101, 250.50, 2);
        Book b2 = new Book(102, 150.75, 3);
        Book b3 = new Book(103, 500.00, 1);
        Book b4 = new Book(104, 100.25, 4);
        Book b5 = new Book(105, 320.40, 2);

        System.out.println("Book Purchase Details:\n");
        b1.displayDetails();
        b2.displayDetails();
        b3.displayDetails();
        b4.displayDetails();
        b5.displayDetails();

        System.out.println("Total amount spent on all books: " + Book.totalAmount);
    }
}

```

### Output
```
Book Purchase Details:

Book ID: 101
Price: 250.5
Quantity: 2
Total cost for this book: 501.0
