# Question 8
## Problem statement
Define two interfaces, Flyable and Swimmable, with the following methods: 

Interface Flyable: 
- A method `fly()` (e.g., "Flying not flying"). 
Interface Swimmable: 
- A method `swim()` (e.g., "Swimming or not swimming").

Define a class Duck that implements both Flyable and Swimmable interfaces. This class should: 
- Implement the `fly()` method from `Flyable` interface. 
- Implement the `swim()` method from `Swimmable` interface. 
- Include an additional instance variable `name` (a String) to store the name of the duck, initialized through the constructor. 
- A `displayDetails()` method to display the duck's name and its capabilities (whether it can fly or swim).

Write a program to: 
- Create an object of `Duck` and initialize its `name`. 
- Call the `fly()` and `swim()` methods using the Duck object. 
- Display the duck's name and its abilities using the `displayDetails()` method.

## Solution
```java
interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

interface Swimmable {
    void swim();
}

class Duck implements Flyable, Swimmable {
    private String name;
    private boolean canFly;
    private boolean canSwim;

    Duck(String name, boolean canFly, boolean canSwim) {
        this.name = name;
        this.canFly = canFly;
        this.canSwim = canSwim;
    }

    public void fly() {
        if (canFly) {
            System.out.println(name + " is flying!");
        } else {
            System.out.println(name + " cannot fly.");
        }
    }

    public void swim() {
        if (canSwim) {
            System.out.println(name + " is swimming!");
        } else {
            System.out.println(name + " cannot swim.");
        }
    }

    public void displayDetails() {
        System.out.println("\nDuck Details:");
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Can Fly: " + (canFly ? "Yes" : "No"));
        System.out.println("Can Swim: " + (canSwim ? "Yes" : "No"));
    }
}

public class DuckDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Duck d1 = new Duck("Ducky", true, true);

        d1.fly();
        d1.swim();

        d1.displayDetails();
    }
}

```

### Output
```
Ducky is flying!
Ducky is swimming!

Duck Details:
Name: Ducky
Can Fly: Yes
Can Swim: Yes

```
