# Question 9
## Problem statement
Define a base class `Employee` with the following instance variables: `name`, `salary`

The `Employee` class should have: 
- A constructor to initialize `name` and `salary`. 
- A method `displayEmployeeInfo()` to display the details of the employee (i.e., name and salary).

Define a derived class `Manager` that extends the `Employee` class and adds an additional instance variable `department` (a String representing the department the manager manages). 

The `Manager` class should: 
- `name` and `salary`. 
- Include a `department` field, which should be initialized in the constructor. 
- Implement a method `displayManagerDetails()` that calls the `displayEmployeeInfo()` method from the `Employee` class (using super) to display the employee's information and also displays the department of the manager. 

Write a program to: 
1. Create an object of `Manager` and initialize its `name`, `salary`, and `department`. 
2. Call the `displayManagerDetails()` method to display the details of the manager. 

## Solution
```java
class Employee {
    protected String name;
    protected double salary;

    Employee(String name, double salary) {
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    public void displayEmployeeInfo() {
        System.out.println("Employee Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Salary: " + salary);
    }
}

class Manager extends Employee {
    private String department;

    Manager(String name, double salary, String department) {
        super(name, salary); 
        this.department = department;
    }

    public void displayManagerDetails() {
        super.displayEmployeeInfo();
        System.out.println("Department: " + department);
    }
}

public class ManagerDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Manager m1 = new Manager("Alice Johnson", 75000, "Human Resources");

        m1.displayManagerDetails();
    }
}

```

### Output
```
Employee Name: Alice Johnson
Salary: 75000.0
Department: Human Resources
```
