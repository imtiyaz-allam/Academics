# Question 6
## Problem statement
Define a base class `Vehicle` with instance variables `model` and `year`. The instance variables are initialized through constructors. The prototype of the constructor is as: 
    ```Vehicle (String, int)```

Define a derived class `Car` with additional instance variables `carId` and `price`. The instance variables are initialized through constructors. The prototype of the constructor is as: 
    ```Car (String, int, int, double) ```

Another instance method of the `Car` class is `carDisplay()` to display the information of car details.

Write a program to: 
- Create an object of the `Car` class and initialize its values. 
- Display both the base class (`Vehicle`) and derived class (`Car`) details using the `carDisplay()` method.

## Solution
```java
class Vehicle {
    protected String model;
    protected int year;

    Vehicle(String model, int year) {
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    private int carId;
    private double price;

    Car(String model, int year, int carId, double price) {
        super(model, year); // Call base class constructor
        this.carId = carId;
        this.price = price;
    }

    public void carDisplay() {
        System.out.println("Car Details:");
        System.out.println("Model: " + model);
        System.out.println("Year: " + year);
        System.out.println("Car ID: " + carId);
        System.out.println("Price: " + price);
    }
}

public class CarDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car1 = new Car("Toyota Corolla", 2022, 101, 18000.50);

        car1.carDisplay();
    }
}

```

### Output
```
Car Details:
Model: Toyota Corolla
Year: 2022
Car ID: 101
Price: 18000.5
```
