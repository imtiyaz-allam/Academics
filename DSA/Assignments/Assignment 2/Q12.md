# Question 12
## Problem statement
Define a base class `Person` with instance variable `name`, `age`.  <br>
The instance variables are initialized through constructors. The prototype of constructor is as below.  
```java
Person (String, int)
``` 
Define a derived class `Employee` with instance variables `eid`, `salary`. <br> 
The instance variables are initialized through constructors. The prototype of constructor is as below. 
```java
Employee (string, int, int, double). 
```
Another instance method of Employee class is `empDisplay()` to display the information of employee details. 

## Solution
```java
class Person {
    String name;
    int age;

    Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}

class Employee extends Person {
    int Eid;
    double salary;

    Employee(String name, int age, int Eid, double salary) {
        super(name, age);  // Call base class constructor
        this.Eid = Eid;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    void empDisplay() {
        System.out.println("Employee Details:");
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
        System.out.println("Employee ID: " + Eid);
        System.out.println("Salary: " + salary);
    }
}

public class EmployeeMain {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee e1 = new Employee("Rahul Sharma", 30, 101, 55000.50);
        e1.empDisplay();
    }
}
```

### Output
```
Employee Details:
Name: Rahul Sharma
Age: 30
Employee ID: 101
Salary: 55000.5
```
