# Question 14
## Problem statement
Define a base class `Distance` with the following instance variables: 
- `feet` (an integer representing the distance in feet) 
- `inches` (an integer representing the distance in inches) 

The Distance class should have: 
- A constructor to initialize feet and inches. 
- A method `displayDistance()` to display the distance in the format: feet' inches".

Now, define a derived class `Measurement` that extends the `Distance` class and adds an additional instance variable `centimetres` (a double representing the distance in centimetres). The Measurement class should: 
- Have a constructor that uses the `super` keyword to call the `Distance` class's constructor to initialize `feet` and `inches`. 
- Include a `centimetres` field, which should be initialized in the constructor. 
- Implement a method `displayMeasurement()` that calls the `displayDistance()` method from the `Distance` class (using `super`) to display the distance in feet and inches, and also displays the distance
