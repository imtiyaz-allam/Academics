# Question 14
## Problem statement
Define a base class `Distance` with the following instance variables: 
- `feet` (an integer representing the distance in feet) 
- `inches` (an integer representing the distance in inches) 

The Distance class should have: 
- A constructor to initialize feet and inches. 
- A method `displayDistance()` to display the distance in the format: feet' inches".

Now, define a derived class `Measurement` that extends the `Distance` class and adds an additional instance variable `centimetres` (a double representing the distance in centimetres). The Measurement class should: 
- Have a constructor that uses the `super` keyword to call the `Distance` class's constructor to initialize `feet` and `inches`. 
- Include a `centimetres` field, which should be initialized in the constructor. 
- Implement a method `displayMeasurement()` that calls the `displayDistance()` method from the `Distance` class (using `super`) to display the distance in feet and inches, and also displays the distance 

## Solution
```java
class Distance {
    int feet;
    int inches;

    Distance(int feet, int inches) {
        this.feet = feet;
        this.inches = inches;
    }

    void displayDistance() {
        System.out.println(feet + "' " + inches + "\"");
    }
}

class Measurement extends Distance {
    double centimetres;

    Measurement(int feet, int inches, double centimetres) {
        super(feet, inches);  // Call base class constructor
        this.centimetres = centimetres;
    }

    void displayMeasurement() {
        System.out.print("Distance: ");
        super.displayDistance();  // Call base class method
        System.out.println("In Centimetres: " + centimetres + " cm");
    }
}

public class MeasurementMain {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Measurement m1 = new Measurement(5, 8, 172.72);

        m1.displayMeasurement();
    }
}
```

### Output
```
Distance: 5' 8"
In Centimetres: 172.72 cm
```
