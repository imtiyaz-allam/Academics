# Question 15
## Problem statement
A point in the x-y plane is represented by its x-coordinate and y coordinate. Design a class, `PointType` in Java, that can store and process a point in the x-y plane. You should then perform operations on the point, such as showing the point, setting the coordinates of the point, printing the coordinates of the point, returning the x-coordinate, and returning the y-coordinate. 

Every circle has a centre and a radius. Given the radius, we can determine the circleâ€™s area and circumference. Given the centre, we can determine its position in the x-y plane. The centre of a circle is a point in the x-y plane. Design a class, `CircleType` that can store the radius and centre of the circle. Because the center is a point in the x-y plane and you designed the class to capture the properties of a point from `PointType` class. You must derive the class `CircleType` from the class `PointType`. You should be able to perform the usual operations on a circle, such as setting the radius, printing the radius, calculating and printing the area and circumference, and carrying out the usual operations on the center.
