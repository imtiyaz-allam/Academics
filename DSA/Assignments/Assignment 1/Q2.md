# Question 2
## Problem Statement
The body mass index (BMI) is commonly used by health and nutrition professionals to estimate human  body  fat  in  populations.  It  is  computed  by  taking  the  individual's  weight  (mass)  in kilograms and dividing it by the square of their height in meters. i.e. 
Metric: <br>  
$$BMI = \frac{weight ~ (kg)}{height^2 ~ (m)}$$ 
 
Write a java program by using conditional statement to show the category for a given BMI
|Category|BMI|
|----|----|
Less than 18.5 | Underweight  
18.5 to 24.9 | Normal Weight 
25.0 to 29.9 | Overweight
30.0 or more | Obese

__Sample Run-1:__ <br>
Enter person Weight in kg: 68 <br>
Enter height of person in meter: 2 <br>
The person is Underweight. <br>

__Sample Run-2:__ <br>
Enter person Weight in kg: 96 <br>
Enter height of person in meter: 1.4 <br>
The person is Obese.<br>

## Solution

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class A1Q2 {

    public static void BMI(double w, double h) {
        double bmi = w / Math.pow(h, 2);
        if (bmi < 18.5)
            System.out.println("Underweight");
        else if (bmi >= 18.5 && bmi <= 24.9)
            System.out.println("Normal weight");
        else if (bmi >= 25 && bmi <= 29.9)
            System.out.println("Overweight");
        else
            System.out.println("Obese");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter person Weight in kg: ");
        double w = sc.nextDouble();
        System.out.print("Enter height of person in meter: ");
        double h = sc.nextDouble();
        System.out.print("The person is ");
        BMI(w, h);
    }
}

```

### Output
``` 
Enter person Weight in kg: 65 
Enter height of person in meter: 1.63 
The person is Normal weight.
```
