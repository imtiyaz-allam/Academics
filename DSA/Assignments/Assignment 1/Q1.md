# Question 1
## Problem Statement
Write a Java program that can take a positive integer greater than 2 as input and write out the number of times one must repeatedly divide this number by 2 before getting a value less than 2. 
 
__Sample Run:__
 
The positive integer greater than 2 from command line argument 
is 67. <br>
The number of times one must repeatedly divide this number by 2 
before getting a value less than 2 is 5.

## Solution
```java
public class A1Q1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        int c = 0;
        while(x > 2) {
            c++;
            x /= 2;
        }
        System.out.printf("The number of times one must repeatedly "
                + "divide this number by 2 before getting a value "
                + "less than 2 is " + c);
    }
}
```

### When 67 is passed in command line argument the output is
```
The number of times one must repeatedly divide this number by 2 before getting a value less than 2 is 
```
