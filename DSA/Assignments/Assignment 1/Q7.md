# Question 7
## Problem Statement
Write a java program to find the maximum and minimum and how many times they both occur in an array of n elements. Find out the positions where the maximum first occurs and the minimum last occurs. 
 
__Sample Run:__ <br>
Enter number of elements of Array: 5 <br>
Enter elements of the array: 12 14 12 14 13 <br>
Maximum element of Array is 14 and occurs 2 times.<br> 
Minimum element of Array is 12 and occurs 2 times. <br>
First occurrence of maximum element is at position 2. <br>
Last occurrence of minimum element is at position 3. 

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class A1Q7 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter number of elements of Array: ");
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        System.out.print("Enter elements of the array: ");
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
            arr[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        int max = arr[0], min = arr[0];
        int maxCount = 0, minCount = 0, firstMaxPos = -1, lastMinPos = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > max) {
                max = arr[i];
                maxCount = 1;
                firstMaxPos = i + 1;
            } else if (arr[i] == max) {
                maxCount++;
                if (firstMaxPos == -1) {
                    firstMaxPos = i + 1;
                }
            }
            
            if (arr[i] < min) {
                min = arr[i];
                minCount = 1;
                lastMinPos = i + 1;
            } else if (arr[i] == min) {
                minCount++;
                lastMinPos = i + 1;
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Maximum element of Array is " + max + " and occurs " + maxCount + " times.");
        System.out.println("Minimum element of Array is " + min + " and occurs " + minCount + " times.");
        System.out.println("First occurrence of maximum element is at position " + firstMaxPos + ".");
        System.out.println("Last occurrence of minimum element is at position " + lastMinPos + ".");
    }
}
```

### Output
```
Enter number of elements of Array: 5 
Enter elements of the array: 12 14 12 14 13
Maximum element of Array is 14 and occurs 2 times.
Minimum element of Array is 12 and occurs 2 times. 
First occurrence of maximum element is at position 2.
Last occurrence of minimum element is at position 3.
```
