# Home Assignment: Question 8
## Problem statement
In the Towers of Hanoi puzzle, we are given a platform with three pegs, `a`, `b`, and `c`, sticking out of it. On peg `a` is a stack of $n$ disks, each larger than the next, so that the smallest is on the top and the largest is on the bottom. The puzzle is to move all the disks from peg `a` to peg `c`, moving one disk at a time, so that we never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one. See Figure for an example of the case n = 4. Write a recursive program using Java for solving the Towers of Hanoi puzzle for arbitrary n. 

(<b>Hint</b>: Consider first the subproblem of moving all but the nth disk from peg a to another peg using the third as “temporary storage.”)
