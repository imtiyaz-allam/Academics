# Question 4
## Problem statement
Write a simple main class in Java that contains an experiment that uses the generic `Box<T>` class to build boxes with different types and that verifies that this class works as advertised.

Your experiment should include the following:
- Create a boxed `String` object and two variables that refer to that box. Change the contents of one and determine the effect on the other.
- Create a boxed `Integer` object and two variables that refer to that box. Change the contents of one and determine the effect on the other.
- Create a boxed `Object` object and two variables that refer to that box. Determine what happens if you put a string in the box. Determine what happens if you put an integer in the box
