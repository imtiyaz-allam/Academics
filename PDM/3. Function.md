# Function

In discrete mathematics, a function is a rule or relationship that assigns each element from one set (called the domain) to exactly one element in another set (called the co-domain). Think of it as a mapping or a transformation.

More formally, a function $f$ from a set $A$ to a set $B$, denoted as $f: A \to B$, is a relation that satisfies the following two properties:

1.  **Totality:** For every element $a$ in $A$, there is an element $b$ in $B$ such that $f(a) = b$. In simpler terms, every element in the domain must be mapped to something in the co-domain.
2.  **Uniqueness:** If $f(a) = b$ and $f(a) = c$, then $b = c$. This means that each element in the domain is mapped to only one element in the co-domain.

**Key Components**

* **Domain ($A$):**
    * The domain is the set of all possible input values for the function.
    * It's the set from which the function takes its arguments.
    * In $f: A → B$, $A$ is the domain.
* **co-domain ($B$):**
    * The co-domain is the set of all possible output values for the function.
    * It's the set where the function's results are expected to reside.
    * In $f: A → B$, $B$ is the co-domain.
* **Range (or Image):**
    * The range is the set of all actual output values of the function.
    * It's a subset of the co-domain.
    * The range consists of all $b$ in $B$ such that $f(a) = b$ for some $a$ in $A$.
    * The range is always a subset of the co-domain.

**Illustrative Example**

Let's say we have:

* Domain ($A$) = $\lbrace 1, 2, 3\rbrace $
* co-domain ($B$) = $\lbrace A, B, C, D\rbrace $
* Function $f$:
    * $f(1) = D$
    * $f(2) = C$
    * $f(3) = C$

In this example:

* The __domain__ is $\lbrace 1, 2, 3\rbrace $.
* The __co-domain__ is $\lbrace A, B, C, D\rbrace $.
* The __range__ is $\lbrace D, C\rbrace $. Notice that $B$ and $A$ are in the co-domain but not in the range because no element in the domain maps to them. Also notice that $a$ is in the range, even though it is the output of two domain inputs.

**Important Notes**

* A function must map each element of the domain to exactly one element of the co-domain.
* The range is always a subset of the co-domain, but it doesn't necessarily have to be equal to the co-domain.
* Discrete mathematics often deals with functions that operate on finite or countable sets.

## Classification of Functions
### 1. Injective Function
A function $f:A \to B$ is called injective if different points of $A$ ara mapped to different elements in $B$

__Example:__

$f: \lbrace 1, 2, 3 \rbrace \to \lbrace 5, 6, 7, 8 \rbrace$

### 2. Surjective Function
A function $f:A \to B$ is called surjective or on-to function if every point in co-domain has a pre-image in set $A$

### 3. Bijective Function
A function $f:A \to  B$ is called bijection if it is both onto and one-to-one i.e 

1. Range = co-domain
2. Every element in co-domain has exactly one pre-image in domain

### Injection Checking
```py
def injection_check(func:callable, domain:set):
    output_values = {}
    for x in domain:
        fx = func(x)
        if fx in output_values:
            return False
        output_values[fx] = x
    return True

f1 = lambda x: x ** 2
domain = list(range(-10, 11))
output = injection_check(f1, domain)
print("Injective" if output else "Not Injective")
```

### Surjection Checking
```py
def surjection_check(func:callable, domain:set, codomain:set):
    rng = set()
    for x in domain:
        rng.add(func(x))
    return rng == set(codomain)

f1 = lambda x: x ** 2
domain = list(range(-10, 11))
codomain = {0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100}
output = surjection_check(f1, domain, codomain)
print("Surjective" if output else not "Not Surjective")
```
